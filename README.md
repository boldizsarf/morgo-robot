# morgo-robot
Morgó is an Arduino servo based walking robot.

This is my first Arduino project, I just created for fun, but if you want, you can make this robot also. The robot is still in development stage. 

## What I've done so far
- Created the robot's platform
- Soldered the servos to the Arduino
- Written the code for sit up and walking

## Todo List
- Solder on a 9V battery connector
- Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino
- Write the code for walking and turning to all directions
- Write the smart obstacle avoidance code
- Better cable management
- RC capability
- Twerk dance

> Used board: Arduino Nano

## Connection diagram
- Front right servo: D11
- Front left servo: D10
- Rear right servo: D3
- Rear left servo: D9
- 5V rail: 5V
- Ground rail: GND
